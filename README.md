# system-task-management
Using the 1 3 5 approach, inspired by [Time Doctor](https://www.timedoctor.com/blog/1-3-5-rule/). 

##Â How this works
At the beginning of each day or end of prior day write a list of todos as Github issues using the relevant template for daily or weekly, daily tasks can be pulled from your weekly list. As new tasks crop up capture them on your next week list or shuffle your this week list to fit in things that are on :fire: At the end of each day close the issue transferring any incomplete task to the next day/weekly lists. At the end of the week do the same for the weekly list. I kept this week and next week on the same issue for ease of edit. 

You can then use the issues to help you write your week notes if that's your thing.
