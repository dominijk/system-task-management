# system-task-management
Using the 1 3 5 approach, inspired by [Time Doctor](https://www.timedoctor.com/blog/1-3-5-rule/). Initially I ran this in iA Writer to beenfit from the syncing across devices. The trade off is between versioning benefits Github offers and ease of use that iA Writer offers. If using iA Writer or another markdown editor then strike through is preferble to toggle boxes.

Assumes your day is between
|Min day length |Max day length  | 
|:--- |:---- |
|6.5 hours| 8.5 hours|

## How this works
At the beginning of each day or end of prior day write a list of todos as Github issues using the relevant template for daily or weekly, daily tasks can be pulled from your weekly list. As new tasks crop up capture them on your next week list or shuffle your this week list to fit in things that are on :fire: At the end of each day close the issue transferring any incomplete task to the next day/weekly lists. At the end of the week do the same for the weekly list. I kept this week and next week on the same issue for ease of edit. 

You can then use the issues to help you write your week notes if that's your thing.
